1. The biggest challenge that I had with this project was getting vercel to work. I thought the insructions for this assignment, especailly for someone who has never used vercel before, was a little vague.
2. I leanred how to go out and find an api, and how to impliment it into my code without a set of directions, also got a basic intro into how to use vercel. Would still like to work with it a bit more before I consider myself comfortable with it.
3. I had to make a requirements.txt file to add in my imports, also had to add in a templates folder and index.html to build the template of the website.
4. I would assume it is becasue it is using the ip address of the vercel server location, vs the ip address of my local machine.
